Hello Tasha! I am doing the Intro to Github Session 1 part 2 (from Canva):

Create a new repository and a readme.md file. 
Create a pull request of your assigned partnerâ€™s readme.md and add in a greeting to their document. 
Check the PR your partner has opened with changes to your readme.md. 
Comment and accept the PR if it fulfills the assignment requirements.

Hello Jarrod!
